## I Cannot Thank You Enough



### The Idea
The whole thing came from my former boss, who sent me the following email:
> Magnificent!
>
>I cannot thank you enough.
>
>(However, if you go to ‘icannotthankyouenough.com’ and select ‘insufficient gratitude compensator generator’ and type in my details you’ll receive any shortfall of thanks over the next few months until the appropriate level of gratitude has been achieved.)

First I thought the site was real, but it turns out that it's just something he came up with. I decided to make it a reality.


### Status of Project
I've had a busy month, plus I'm inexperienced in web development so only the React front-end is presentable so far. I also worked on backend stuff, trying to figure out the email-sending capability server-side and such, but those are very much works in progress.

You can find a running version of the frontend at https://borntobegeek.me/ictye/.
